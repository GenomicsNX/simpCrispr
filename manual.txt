This script is used to analyze CRISPR offtarget sites.
Below are what could be done with that script:


It can find gRNAs for a given fasta file or given chr,start,end 
and for each gRNA it will find all potential offtarget sites and 
score these with the same formula used in (http://crispr.mit.edu/about),
the score matrix can be modified if needed.
The it will rank gRNAs based on the total score of corresponding offtarget sites.
It will write primer region for a given number of top rated offtargets for all gRNAs.
It will write all the results to an excel file

It should be run on a unix machine and it mainly has bash and python scripts and it employs NGS tools,
bowtie for alignment, bedtools and homer tools.
For python , pandas and numpy packages should be installed.

How it works:

It runs bowtie for alignment 
It runs bedtools 
It runs homer tools, annotatePeaks.pl if annotation is needed
These should be installed
